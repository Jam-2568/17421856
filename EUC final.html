        <strong><h2>Experiences</h2></strong>
		
        <h4>Experiences 1 Lab Work </h4>
        <p align="justify">5+ years as working in a lab. during this time, many precatuins and procedures were carried out. When going for QQI level 5, a year was spent in dunboyne college
         of further education, where the neccessary safety precations and lab equipemtn was explained and taught to me. Using this knwoledge, it help me through working in a lab for 4 years in
		 maynooth university where I spent 2 years in a Chemistry Lab and 4 years in a Biology Lab. these Labs furthered my knowlegde of labratory work in both the chemiostry and the biology fields.
		 
		 
		 
         <h4>Experiences 2  Research </h4>
         <p align="justify">During the course of my BSC Science course,I gained extensive experience in research. research was a major part in gaining my Level 8 QQI Bsc degree.
		 Reserching material that was needed for projects and general understanding of subjects allowed me to grasp and further understand all aspectss of chemiostry and primarily Biology.
		 research in Biology allowed me to gain knowledfe of Microbiolgy, Molecular Biology, Animal Anatomy and Biology and Ecology

    <strong><h2>Projects</h2></strong>

    <h3>Project 1:Microbes in the soil of wild fire prone forests of Australia </h3>
    <p align="justify"> this project i did in 3rd. it involved researching how forests in austraila that are prone to wild fiores bounce back and floruish once again. it allowed me to better understand how
	microbes recyle the dead materials after a fire and turn it into nutirents, allowing plants that have been affected by fire to grow again using these nutrients.

     <h3>Project 2 The impact of ash dieback Hymenoscyphus fraxineus in Irish forests</h3>
     <p align="justify">This is my final year project. it focuses on hiow irish ash trees are being killed off by the parasite  Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. there is alot of research behind it and the planting of ash is
	 now forbidden by irish law as they expect ash trees to be killed off due to the parasite.
